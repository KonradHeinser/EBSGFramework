This framework contains all the C# that I made that can be utilized for broad purposes. While it mostly contains stuff for the Expanded Biotech Style Genes series, it also has generic copies of some of the code made for the Superhero Genes series, like the code used to remove multiple hediffs with one ability. By putting it all in one framework, I'm hoping it will make it easier for others to do some of this stuff. Important note, the code from SHG also still has an SHG equivalent, but there is no guarantee that they will act the same as those ones are intended solely for SHG and any mods that have it as a dependency.

Some things this contains includes:
 - Stats that alter deathrest, pregnancy, and blood recovery speeds.
 - Create basic resource genes like Hemogen using just xml
 - Locking equipment based on genes, xenotypes, and hediffs, using required or forbidden tags.
 - Locking genes and xenotypes to only use certain equipment, or have certain equipment forbidden.
 - Create thoughts that check for trees similar to the Trees Desired precept.
 - Create mood curves based on how many people are in the colony.
 - Create hediffs that damage and even completely remove specific parts.
 - Create hive mind genes.
 - And more! A lot more. Take a look at the wiki for a full list.
