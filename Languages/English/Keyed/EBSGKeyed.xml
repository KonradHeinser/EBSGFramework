    <EBSG_ModDescription>The Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) Framework is a compilation of all the code used in the EBSG series, generic versions of most code use in the Superhero Genes Series, along with various other bits of convenient code suggested by others or the voice in my head.\n\nBecause this is a framework, there are very few settings to look at. The only things that will ever be added to this list are the optional quality of life patches made to apply this framework's code to vanilla things.\n\nThe checkmark next to the label just hides the group, if you want to do that for whatever reason.</EBSG_ModDescription>
